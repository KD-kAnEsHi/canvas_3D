About Thingi10K
===============

Thingi10K is a large scale 3D dataset created to study the variety, complexity
and quality of real-world 3D printing models. We analyze every mesh of all
things featured on Thingiverse.com between Sept. 16, 2009 and Nov. 15, 2015. On
this site, we hope to share our findings with you.
